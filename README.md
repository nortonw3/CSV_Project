Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib


csv_temps_1.py
    This program takes "sitka_weather_07-2018_simple.csv" and teaches us the basic use of matplotlib functions in order to create a simple graph. The graph only pertains to the high temperatures for the month of July in Sitka Airport

csv_temps_2.py
    This program expands upon what we did in the previous program by reading in the dates as well as the daily high temperatures

csv_temps_3.py
    This program expands upon what we did in the previous program. Instead of a single month, we read in an entire years worth of data. We also read in the daily low temperatures as well as autoformatting the dates to read out every month instead of every signle day.

csv_temps_4.py
    This program teaches us the use of try/exception blocks. We changed the file to "death_valley_2018_simple.csv" which is filled with intentional errors to throw us off.

csv_temps_5.py
    This is our final program. Our goal is to read in both .csv files, find the correct indexes for the station name, dates, as well as the daily high and low temperatures. Then we were tasked with graphing both to a single plot so we can compare the two.
